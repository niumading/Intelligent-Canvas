/**
 * Saves a full motion scene (objects/transforms/poses/keyframes/duration +
 * the active shot composition) so it can later be surfaced as a reusable
 * community scene. No browse/marketplace UI yet — this is just the save-side
 * data flow, mirroring composer/helpers/poseLibrary.ts's localStorage-array
 * pattern (same slugify+dedupe shape) since that's the only precedent for
 * "save a reusable thing" already in this codebase.
 *
 * ponytail: persistence is localStorage, per browser/device. Add a real
 * backend + list/browse UI when scenes need to be shared between machines
 * or surfaced as an actual community library.
