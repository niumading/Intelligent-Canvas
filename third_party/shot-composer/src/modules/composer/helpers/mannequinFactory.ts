 * `GROUND_LEVEL = -0.7`, the height of the ground disc in mannequin-js's
 * built-in Stage, which this app does not use — its grid is at y = 0, so every
 * call sank the figure 0.7, about 40% of a 1.8-unit body, taking it under the
 * grid and under the invisible deselect plane. And it writes a *world*-space
 * measurement straight into a *local* `position.y`, which is only the same thing
 * when the figure is a direct child of the scene, as it is in the prototype.
 * Here every figure hangs off a wrapper Group carrying the object transform, so
 * the wrapper's own Y was silently cancelled out.
 *
 * Same three steps as the original — clear the offset, measure, re-offset — with
 * the measurement converted back through the parent's world Y scale. The 0.01
 * sink is mannequin-js's own, and keeps the soles out of the grid plane.
